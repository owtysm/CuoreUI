# CuoreUI.Winforms
> [!NOTE]
> CuoreUI is in development

This is a C# .NET Winforms Library with *modern-looking* controls, components and forms. The library features many controls with a sleek design inspired by Xiaomi and modern web design.

## 🗿 Why use Cuore
Many promise to give you a *"modern design"*, but they can sometimes look old or feel clunky.

So, CuoreUI draws inspiration from the latest modern, *often web* designs. Supports control animations, blur effects on controls, and rounded forms for a sleek, modern look, yet is lightweight.
